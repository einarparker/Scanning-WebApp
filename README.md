# Scanning-WebApp
 WebApp for scanning I use for work.
 Simple webpage withing google Sheets using Apps Script, truncates scanned 
 arriving parcel code to simple DPD tracking number. 
 Puts the tracking code, adds current date and word "arrived" in the right columns in a designated Spreadsheet.
 Conditional formatting takes care of the rest.

 I plan to add few more scanning options as I have more spreadsheets that I need to scan into.
